# Templates of cluster-storage-operator objects.

Generated files in this directory with "hypershift" name come from https://github.com/openshift/cluster-storage-operator.

* To update the generated files, copy
  [`manifests/*-hypershift`](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-storage-operator/tree/master/manifests)
  from github.com/openshift/cluster-storage-operator to here, without any changes.
* All changes in these files should be done in github.com/openshift/cluster-storage-operator repository,
  so we keep authoritative source of all cluster-storage-operator objects on a single place.

Role and rolebinding is custom for hypershift only.
